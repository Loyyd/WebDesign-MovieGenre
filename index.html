                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I started my work experience as a bartender, where I learned for a long time how to deal with good communication, teamwork and multitasking skills. I learned how do work under high pressure and take responsibility.</p>
                <p>After some time I switched over finding a job where I could use my 3d modeling skills to work for other companies. The job developed my skills and supported me on my personal journey. The 3d industry taught me how to apply my creativity and teamwork in a professional setting. I learned a lot and got opportunities to work on a feature film.</p>
                <p>On my may I learned how to 3d model, sculpt, texture, rig and render out various 3d projects.</p>
