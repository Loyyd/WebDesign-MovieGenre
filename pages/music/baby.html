        <p>
            <strong>Story telling through song:</strong> 
                Throughout the film there are clear ties between the song chosen for a scene and the current environment or situation. In the intro the song fades in and out depedning on things like cars passing or the character removing his headphones. It draws in the viewer in a creative way and sets itself up as a fiml that cares about the finer details of the sound design.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>It's Childish-ness:</strong> 
                The main character Baby has been a getaway driver since he was 12. He has grown up entirely within the world of criminal activity yet has retained childish whimsical behaviours like singing in the car as he waits for the crew to return. In a world full of serious action characters Baby as a character seems more human.

          <h1>My Favourite Song</h1>
          <h3>The Jon Spncer Blues Explosion - Bellbottoms</h3>

        <div class="artist-info">
        <p>Bellbottoms encapsulated my favourite aspect of Baby Driver. It is reaistic to the type of music a young rebelious child would listen to, with the subject matter harkennning back to the Greasers of the 60's that Baby sees himself as. It is a beautifully intese song that does'nt feel out of plcae in the scene.</div>
