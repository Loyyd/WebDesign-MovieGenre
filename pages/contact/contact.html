                    <li>Initialised the Github project and workflow</li>
                    <li>created the general Layout and started with the initial draft of css</li>
                    <li>created nav bar and footer for every page</li>
                    <li>created the logo</li>
                    <li>made the layout for the homepage and created the universal css file</li>
                    <li>my part was the action movie section</li>
                    <li>designed the contact us form</li>
                    <li>made the about us page</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Created the addendum for our web design project, which included key reflection questions such as the purpose of the site, our target audience, the structure of the website, accessibility considerations, maintenance plans, and how we worked together as a group. 
						These questions helped evaluate the project from multiple angles and gave a deeper understanding of our design choices.</li>
                    <li>my section of the project was the horror movies section</li>
					<li>I created a custom CSS file for the horror movies section of our website to make it visually distinct while keeping the design consistent with the other sections. 
						This allowed the movies content to stand out without breaking the overall look and feel of the site.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I did ..</li>
                    <li>and ..</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Konrad Kunkel</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a long time is was trying to make image sources (src) to use absolute paths, 
                        but I realized that absolute paths are not working for local testing since my browser just opens an html file and doesn't know where the defined root is for the site.
                        So instead I converted all paths to use relative paths. 
                        This way I ensure pictures are getting loaded properly as long as the file structure is the same.
                    </li>
                     <li>Another mistake I made was to mix up my naming convention for classes.
                         At the beginning of the project I used different naming and didnt realize that the css files are getting messy.
                         So I renamed some classes to keep it more consistent.
                    </li>

                <h2>P.K</h2>

                    <li>and ..</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Alexandru Fechete</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>At the beginning of the project, I didn’t organize my sections of the website very well, which made it difficult to coordinate with the rest of the team. 
						I worked on certain pages without fully aligning them with our overall layout and design style, which meant I had to redo parts of my work later to ensure consistency.</li>
                    <li>I initially overlooked several accessibility requirements when working on my part of the site. 
						I didn’t add alt text to some images, and a few color choices didn’t meet proper contrast guidelines, which could make the content harder to read for some users. 
						Because of this, I had to spend extra time going back through my pages, adjusting the colors, adding descriptive alt text, and making sure the layout was usable for all visitors.</li>
